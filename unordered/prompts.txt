using all your references could you create a lesson explaining how the geometry of the railway track is designed. Please, provide an introduction, explain the general concepts of centrifugal force and acceleration, cant, cant deficiency and excess. Explain the design parameters (speed, safety and comfort) as per ADIF, Network Rail and HS2 as per their standards.
Explain plan alignment design, the different math formula and minimum, maximum and preferred parameters for the different standards, speeds, etc,
Explain vertical alignment design, inclination and acceleration limits, sudden changes of vertical acceleration, etc
Explains the limits for interoperability of all these parameters.

using all your references could you create a lesson explaining the following topics from the perspective of ADIF, Network Rail and HS2 standards:
- Definition of track, track types functions and parts
