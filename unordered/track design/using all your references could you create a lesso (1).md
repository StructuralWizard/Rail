Also, can you give me a perspective of the above from the ADIF, Network Rail and HS2 standards?

Ballasted track for modern high‑speed and mixed‑traffic railways is defined by tightly specified layer thicknesses, materials, and component performances in national standards (ADIF, Network Rail, HS2) as well as by classical track design theory. The following “lesson” is structured from subgrade upwards, and closes with a comparison of ADIF, Network Rail and HS2 practice.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

***

## Formation, ballast and subballast

The formation (platform) provides the ultimate bearing layer; above it, subballast and ballast complete the structural system.[^1]

- ADIF (via the Cantabria notes) classifies platform bearing capacity as P1/P2/P3 (CBR ranges) and soil quality as QS0–QS3, then selects a formation “capa de forma” thickness to reach the required class.[^1]
- For P3 (good) platforms, typical total thickness of ballast plus subballast $e$ ranges from 0.50–0.80 m depending on fictitious daily traffic $T_f$, with high‑speed (Group 1A/1B) requiring at least 0.60 m and normally 0.45 m ballast thickness.[^1]


### Thicknesses – ADIF practice

From the Plataforma y Balasto document and NRV 3‑4‑1.0:[^1]

- **Ballast thickness (under sleeper soffit)**
    - High‑speed (Group 1A, $T_f$ ≥ 85,000 t/day): 45 cm (ballast) with total $e$ ≥ 60 cm; minimum 50 cm only by exception.[^1]
    - Groups 1B–2: 35–40 cm.
    - Secondary/light lines (Groups 3–4): 25–30 cm.
- **Subballast / “capa sub‑balasto”**
    - At least half of total thickness $e$. When ballast needs to be thicker than $e/2$, subballast is increased by the same amount.[^1]
    - Typical design: 20–25 cm subballast for P2/P3 platforms under main lines (see Fig. 5.1.b in the notes).[^1]

ADIF also prescribes a trapezoidal ballast section with shoulders (“hombros”) typically 0.90–1.05 m wide from rail centre depending on line group.[^1]

### Thicknesses – Network Rail (NR/L2/TRK/2102)

Network Rail defines minimum ballast depths under sleepers by track category (1A–6) and sleeper type:[^4]

- **Ballast depth under sleeper**
    - Cat 1A–1 (new CEN60, concrete sleepers): 300 mm.[^4]
    - Cat 2: 250 mm for concrete; 200 mm for steel sleepers.[^4]
    - Cat 3–6: 200 mm (concrete) and 150 mm (steel).[^4]
    - If blanketing or geotextiles are used, a minimum 300 mm (1A–1) or 250 mm (2–6) ballast is kept above them.[^4]
- **Shoulder dimensions (CWR)**
    - On open CWR track, shoulder width ≥ 450 mm (straight >125 mph and curves ≤2000 m) or ≥375 mm up to 125 mph; height typically 125 mm above sleeper top.[^4]


### Thicknesses – HS2

HS2 treats “protection layer/sub‑ballast” as either granular fill or bituminous asphalt, with high requirements due to 360 km/h operation and 60‑year life.[^3]

- **Ballast depth (between protection layer and sleeper)**
    - High‑speed main line: nominal 300 mm (earthworks) with a minimum depth per Table 1; 250 mm in depots and lower‑category areas.[^3]
- **Protection layer / asphalt subballast**
    - Typical asphalt protection layer depths: 120 mm over earthworks, 50 mm over structures.[^3]
    - Granular protection layer below slab or asphalt typically ~300 mm under straight uncanted track in European practice.[^3]

***

## Ballast section and elements

A standard ballast section comprises the load‑spreading and restraining prism surrounding sleepers.[^5][^1]

Main geometric elements (Cantabria/ADIF terminology):[^1]

- **Capa de enrase**: top surface of the ballast prism, about 2 cm below lowest rail foot point.[^1]
- **Espesor de balasto**: vertical distance from formation “capa de forma” to sleeper underside.[^1]
- **Hombro**: horizontal distance from outer rail to ballast edge, typically 0.90–1.05 m depending on line group.[^1]
- **Derrame**: sloping side at the angle of repose.
- **Subballast layer** between ballast and platform: typically 0.15–0.20 m in ADIF examples.[^1]

Network Rail and HS2 specify similar shoulder width and height, and insist ballast is kept clear of fastenings, flangeways, and conductor/third rail equipment.[^3][^4]

***

## Ballast material, properties, requirements and tests

### Material and properties – ADIF

The Cantabria “Balasto” chapter and ADIF ET 03.360.004.0 define a high‑quality crushed rock ballast:[^5][^1]

- **Origin**: siliceous, igneous or metamorphic rock (granites, quartzites, etc.). Limestone and dolomitic rocks are generally excluded for first‑class ballast.[^1]
- **Particle shape**: angular, polyhedral, with sharp edges; flaky and elongated particles are limited via a shape index (≤10% non‑cubical by UNE‑EN 933‑4).[^1]
- **Size (granulometry)**:
    - Main fraction 31.5–63 mm, with control using sieves 63, 50, 40, 31.5, 22.4 mm and defined “husos granulométricos” (grading envelopes).[^1]
- **Mechanical strength**:
    - Uniaxial compressive strength of rock > 1200 kpcm² (approx 120 MPa).[^1]
    - Los Angeles coefficient $C_{LA}$ ≤ 19% for high‑quality ballast; ADIF ballast Type 1 for AV lines typically requires CLA ≤ 14% in the later ET.[^5][^1]
- **Durability**: limits on water absorption, freeze–thaw resistance (boiling test / frost action), and petrographic soundness.[^1]


### Material and properties – Network Rail and HS2

Both require BS EN 13450‑compliant ballast:[^3][^4]

- **Network Rail**: uses RTCES009 and EN 13450; typical Category A or B depending on route, with similar 31.5–50/63 mm grading and LA limits in the mid‑teens.[^4]
- **HS2**: explicitly specifies Category A of EN 13450, particle size 31.5–50 mm, LA ≤ 14, water absorption ≤0.5% and sources from hard siliceous igneous/metamorphic rock.[^3]
- Ballast must be washed prior to installation; washing at quarry is insufficient because fines accumulate during transport and storage.[^3]


### Functional requirements

Ballast must:[^6][^5][^1]

- Provide adequate **shear strength** to resist lateral and longitudinal forces from traffic and thermal expansion.
- Maintain high permeability to drain water and protect formation from frost and softening.
- Maintain shape under tamping and dynamic loads; low abrasion rate, minimal fines generation.

Track Compendium gives typical shear and stiffness behaviours and notes that rigid ballast or highly crushed ballast accelerates deterioration of both track and vehicles at high speed.[^6]

### Tests (typical suite)

Cantabria and ADIF ET 03.360.004.0 list standard tests:[^5][^1]

- **Granulometry**: UNE‑EN 933‑1 dry/wet sieving to verify grading envelopes.
- **Los Angeles abrasion**: UNE‑EN 1097‑2, 10 kg sample with 12 steel balls, 1000 rev; LA coefficient ≤ specified limit.[^1]
- **Shape index / flakiness index**: UNE‑EN 933‑3/4, non‑cubical particles ≤10% by mass.[^1]
- **Fine particles**:
    - Passing 22.4 mm fraction re‑sieved at 0.5 mm and 0.063 mm; fines ≤0.6–1.0% depending on acceptance stage.[^1]
- **Petrographic analysis**: UNE‑EN 932‑3 for rock type and alteration, including homogeneity checks.[^1]
- **Frost resistance / boiling test** for durability.[^1]

HS2/NR require EN 13450 plus national “additional properties”; HS2 emphasises washing and prohibits glued ballast for the main line.[^4][^3]

### Cleaning

Ballast fouling from fines (breakage, pumping, contamination) reduces drainage and stiffness; track quality declines until tamping or cleaning is performed.[^6][^1]

- Traditional maintenance: ballast cleaning machines (e.g., Plasser RM series) excavate, screen, and return clean stone, with subgrade treatment as required.[^6]
- HS2 explicitly prohibits “ballast gluing” on mainline HS track; Network Rail permits glued shoulders locally to increase lateral resistance but requires RAMTrack approval and strict records, with gluing limited to ~200 mm depth and 300 mm width along sleeper ends.[^4]

## Sleepers: types, purpose, design and resistances

### Functions of sleepers

According to Carril_traviesas and Track Compendium, sleepers:[^2][^6]

- Transfer and distribute wheel loads from rails to ballast over a larger area.
- Maintain track gauge, rail inclination (commonly 1:20), and relative rail position.
- Provide lateral and longitudinal restraint via ballast–sleeper interaction.
- Provide electrical isolation where needed (wood naturally, concrete via insulators and pads).

Key geometric factors:

- **Vertical stability**: length and width (bearing area).
- **Lateral stability**: width, height, weight.
- **Longitudinal stability**: three dimensions plus mass and ballast consolidation.[^2]


### Wooden sleepers

Advantages (historically):[^2][^5]

- High elasticity and damping; good track riding comfort.
- Easy to drill and fasten (spikes, coach screws).
- Excellent electrical insulation.
- Good resistance to local overloads (e.g., derailment) without brittle failure.

Disadvantages:[^2]

- Limited life (20–25 years), degradation by rot/biological attack.
- Lower and changing stiffness over time.
- Limited suitability for high‑speed and very high tonnage; fastening loosening over time.

UIC‑type dimensions: lower face width 0.22–0.26 m, height 0.13–0.16 m, upper bearing zones 0.13–0.20 m.[^2]

### Steel sleepers

Steel sleepers are U‑shaped rolled sections with spade ends for ballast embedment; rails are fastened by clamps and screws.[^6][^2]

- Advantages: long life, good gauge holding if well anchored, useful where timber scarce.[^2]
- Disadvantages: corrosion in humid/aggressive environments; poor electrical isolation; not suitable with CWR without special measures; low mass compared to concrete.[^6][^2]

Network Rail currently restricts steel sleepers to lower categories and limits their use on tight curves and high tonnages; not for third‑rail areas, not with high cant deficiency, and not where annual tonnage >10 EMGTPA.[^4]

### Concrete sleepers (reinforced and prestressed)

Evolution in Spain and Europe is clearly described in Carril_traviesas:[^2]

- Early reinforced “parallelepiped” sleepers led to centre‑bound problems and cracking, addressed by central groove or narrowing the middle section.[^2]
- Biblock (two‑block) sleepers with steel tie bars (e.g., RS types) improved flexibility but had problems with tie corrosion, poor gauge retention, and behaviour under derailments.[^2]
- Modern **monoblock prestressed concrete** sleepers (e.g., ADIF AI‑04, MR, PR types) now dominate main and high‑speed lines.[^2]

Advantages of prestressed concrete:[^6][^2]

- Long life (2–3× treated wood) and stable elastic properties.
- High mass (~300 kg) improves lateral and longitudinal resistance, ideal for CWR and high speed.
- Geometry can be optimised (reduced central width) to avoid centre‑bound behaviour.

Disadvantages:

- Higher initial cost and difficult manual handling.
- Higher stiffness (E ≈ 400,000 kN/cm² vs 80,000 for wood) requires thicker ballast and elastic pads to avoid ballast crushing and higher dynamic forces.[^6][^2]
- Requires systematic electrical insulation at each fastener due to concrete’s conductivity.[^2]

ADIF’s current monoblock designs (MR, PR, AI, AE, AM, SR, SI, MM) are tailored for different gauges and loads, all with 2.6–2.75 m length and 54E1/60E1 rail profiles.[^2]

HS2 requires bespoke monoblock prestressed concrete sleepers: C50/60, ≥300 kg, 2600 mm long, 220 mm depth under rail seat, minimum base area 790,000 mm², with under‑sleeper pads.[^3]

### Composite sleepers

Carril_traviesas only briefly mentions “other materials”, while Track Compendium notes polymer/composite sleepers being used in special locations (bridges, environmentally sensitive zones) for their damping and durability. Their use in ADIF, NR and HS2 main line is limited and typically by project‑specific acceptance.[^6][^2]

### Purpose and calculation

Sleeper design balances bending moments from rail loads, ballast support conditions and prestress level:

- Cantabria’s notes show how reinforcement was increased or geometry modified to avoid cracking from negative bending moments in the middle of early reinforced concrete sleepers.[^2]
- Track Compendium provides classical formulas and test requirements (EN 13230) for maximum bending tensile stresses and fatigue life for concrete sleepers under design loads and dynamic factors.[^6]

For practical design, modern administrations rely on EN 13230 plus national load models:

- Network Rail: sleepers must distribute load so ballast and formation are not overstressed; design loads consider static axle load 250 kN and dynamic wheel loads up to 500 kN.[^4]
- HS2: sleeper design per EN 13230‑1 and EN 16730, with additional stiffness and vibration requirements and bespoke verification; sleepers must provide enough flexure to avoid ballast flow but enough stiffness for geometry.[^3]


### Lateral and longitudinal resistance

Track Compendium and Sujeciones y juntas cover resistance contributions:[^5][^6]

- **Longitudinal resistance** of sleepers in ballast is mainly frictional; typical values in Europe are ~20–40 kN per concrete sleeper, with US wooden sleeper values ~11–24 kN (concrete ~1.2–1.67× higher).[^6]
- **Lateral resistance** increases with sleeper mass, end area, shoulder dimensions, ballast consolidation, and use of sleeper anchors or safety caps.[^6]
- ADIF notes typical ballast–sleeper friction values for BLS calculations: ~500 kg (wood), 750 kg (biblock concrete), 1000 kg (monoblock concrete) per sleeper.[^5]

Sleeper anchors and anti‑creep devices are used in critical locations (bridges, transitions, sharp curves) to increase resistance.[^6]

## Fasteners: functions, types and elements

### Functions

Sujeciones y juntas defines “sujeciones” as all elements that fix the rail to the sleeper ensuring a stable rail position. Principal functions:[^5][^6]

- Hold rail to sleeper with adequate clamping force under vertical, lateral and longitudinal loads.
- Maintain gauge and rail inclination; prevent rail roll‑over.
- Transmit loads to sleeper while providing vertical and lateral elasticity and damping.
- Provide electrical insulation between rail and sleeper (especially on concrete track).
- Facilitate assembly, adjustment, and maintenance.

CEN EN 13481/EN 13146 define performance requirements: minimum rail creep resistance, torsional stiffness, vertical/horizontal stiffness ranges, durability under 3×10⁶ load cycles, etc.[^6]

### Elements of a fastening system

Generic components (from Sujeciones y juntas and Track Compendium):[^5][^6]

- **Anchorage elements to sleeper**: screw spikes, bolts, threaded inserts cast into concrete.
- **Baseplate / seat**: may be steel or polymer; distributes load and sets inclination; may be separate or integrated into the rail pad or shoulders.[^5][^6]
- **Elastic rail pad** between rail foot and sleeper/baseplate (rubber, EVA, polyurethane): provides vertical elasticity, load distribution and vibration isolation.[^6]
- **Rail clip / spring element**: holds down rail and controls uplift, lateral restraint and torsional stiffness.
- **Insulating liners and gauge blocks**: maintain gauge and ensure electrical isolation between rail and metallic parts and concrete sleeper.[^5][^6]


### Rigid fastenings

Rigid systems rely on spikes or screw spikes with little or no elastic element:[^5][^6]

- **Dog spikes / “escarpias”**: square‑section spikes hammered into pre‑drilled holes; common in US timber track; high initial clamping but loosens with time due to wood deformation and dynamic loading.[^5][^6]
- **Coach screws / “tirafondos”**: threaded screws into timber, often with steel baseplates; higher withdrawal resistance than spikes and better performance under uplift, but still essentially rigid vertically.[^5]
- On concrete, early rigid designs used embedded timber plugs or cast‑in threaded inserts; these were quickly superseded by elastic systems.[^5][^6]

Rigid fasteners are unsuitable for CWR and high‑speed lines because clamping force decays quickly and creep resistance is low.[^6]

### Elastic fastenings (clip and plate‑spring systems)

Elastic fastenings incorporate a deformable element that maintains clamping force over deflection.[^5][^6]

#### Plate‑spring / “grapa” systems

Examples from Sujeciones y juntas:[^5]

- **RN** system (French origin).
- **G‑4** system (timber sleepers).[^5]
- Spanish **P‑2** and its evolution **J‑2**, designed to replace RN; they improved electrical insulation and gauge stability but suffered from plate and insulating component fatigue.[^5]
- **Nabla** fastening (SNCF): uses a triangular clip with double elasticity; widely used on TGV lines.[^6][^5]

Common shortcomings: need for periodic re‑tightening of nuts, sensitivity to over‑tightening causing plastic deformation of plates, and relatively complex installation.[^5]

#### Clip systems (Pandrol, Vossloh, etc.)

These are the dominant systems on modern concrete sleepers.[^6][^5]

- **Pandrol e‑clip / Fastclip**:
    - Spring steel clip pre‑loaded into shoulders cast into the sleeper; no separate nuts/bolts in the main fastening.[^6]
    - Provides defined clamping force and elasticity; easy to install/remove with simple tools, low maintenance.[^5][^6]
- **Vossloh HM / SKL range (e.g. SKL‑1, SKL‑12, W14, 300 systems)**:
    - Two‑arm psi‑shaped clips anchored in screw spikes; used widely on ADIF high‑speed lines (SKL‑1).[^6][^5]
    - Combined with elastic pads and insulating liners to provide vertical and lateral stiffness and electrical insulation.[^5][^6]

Spanish practice (ADIF) uses direct elastic fastenings (Vossloh SKL‑1 variants) for BLS on AV lines and mostly P‑2/J‑2 legacy or similar on conventional concrete/biblock sleepers.[^5]

HS2 requires fastenings per EN 13481‑2 (ballast) and EN 13481‑5 (slab), with proven high‑speed service and defined vertical and horizontal adjustment reserves (20–70 mm vertical, 10 mm horizontal depending on trackform).[^3]

Network Rail requires self‑tensioning, self‑locking fastenings meeting EN 13481 and EN 13146; non‑self‑tensioning types are restricted to special use.[^4]

### Rigid vs elastic – performance comparison

Track Compendium compares rigid spike systems to elastic clip systems:[^6]

- Rigid fastenings lose clamping force as sleepers or base deform; creep resistance falls toward zero as uplift and tilting of rail occur.[^6]
- Elastic systems maintain a pulsating clamping force around the initial tension, ensuring continuous hold‑down and high rail creep resistance even under dynamic loads.[^6]
- EN 13481 requires minimum rail creep resistance of 7 kN per fastening; modern clip systems comfortably exceed this.[^6]

***

## ADIF, Network Rail and HS2 – perspective and alignment

### Ballast and formation

- **ADIF**: classic ballast/subballast/platform design with CBR‑based platform categories and granular subballast; no routine asphalt layers except in specific projects; ballast thickness up to 45 cm in AV lines, total $e$ ≥ 60 cm.[^1]
- **Network Rail**: similar structural concept but with strong emphasis on formation stiffness (minimum stiffness 45 MN/m for Cat 1A–2 renewals) and blanketing/trackbed design per NR/L2/TRK/4239.[^4]
- **HS2**: moves to asphalt protection layers under ballasted track to stabilise stiffness and extend tamping intervals; ballasted track used only where feasible and complemented with extensive slab track in constrained areas.[^3]


### Ballast quality

- All three use EN 13450 as base, Category A for high‑speed; HS2 explicitly requires LA ≤14 and low water absorption, essentially equivalent to ADIF’s Type 1 ballast for AV.[^3][^5]
- ADIF distinguishes Type A and B ballast and allows some calcareous ballast for lower lines; HS2 and Network Rail strongly favour siliceous/metamorphic sources.[^3][^4][^1]


### Sleepers

- **ADIF**: monoblock prestressed concrete sleepers (AI, AE, MR, PR, AM, etc.) with Vossloh SKL‑type fastenings are standard on main and AV lines; wood and metal retained only for legacy or special cases.[^2][^5]
- **Network Rail**: new high‑category lines require concrete CEN56/60 sleepers at 600–650 mm spacing; hardwood only where concrete is impractical (tunnels, check‑rail curves) and closely controlled.[^4]
- **HS2**: only bespoke monoblock prestressed concrete sleepers with under‑sleeper pads and 600 mm spacing on main lines; minimum 300 kg mass and carefully controlled stiffness.[^3]


### Fastenings

- All three now rely on **elastic clip systems** on concrete sleepers, meeting EN 13481/13146.
- ADIF: long history of RN, P‑2, J‑2, Vossloh SKL and Nabla; current AV lines predominantly Vossloh SKL‑1 with elastic pads and insulators.[^5]
- Network Rail: specifies self‑tensioning elastic fastenings with product acceptance; numerous Pandrol and Vossloh variants used, tuned by line category and support conditions.[^4][^6]
- HS2: requires high‑stiffness, high‑resilience fastenings with significant adjustment reserves and proven slab‑track performance; clip spacing 600–650 mm; no glued ballast; under‑sleeper pads integral to the system.[^3]


### Lateral and longitudinal stability / CWR

- ADIF’s BLS (Barra Larga Soldada) chapter sets out design of neutral temperature, breathing lengths and dilatation devices; sleepers and fastenings must provide high creep resistance, especially in curves and at transitions.[^5]
- Network Rail uses a target SFT of 27°C for CWR on concrete and wood sleepers, with detailed rules for stressing, SC compatibility, lateral resistance plates on SC, and ballast shoulders widths.[^4]
- HS2 uses SFT = 27°C for ballasted track and 21°C for slab track, with strict stiffness transition design and under‑sleeper pads to manage ballast movement.[^3]

***

If desired, the next step can be a worked design example (e.g., selecting ballast and subballast thickness and sleeper/fastening type for a 250 km/h double‑track line in each regime, showing the layer build‑up and key checks).
