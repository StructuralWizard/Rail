# Lesson: Ballasted vs. Ballastless (Slab) Track Technologies

This lesson compares the performance, mechanics, and lifecycle properties of traditional **ballasted track** (rails on sleepers supported by crushed stone) versus **ballastless (slab) track** (rails on a rigid concrete or asphalt base).

### 1. Deformation

* **Ballasted Track:** Exhibits both elastic (recoverable) and plastic (permanent) deformation under load. The ballast behaves as a granular material where grains rearrange over time, leading to settlement. This plastic deformation is initially exponential (rapid settlement after tamping) and then becomes linear.[^1]
* **Ballastless Track:** Designed to be a "non-settling" system. The concrete or asphalt layers are rigid, and deformation is almost entirely elastic. Settlement is negligible (0.5–2 mm) compared to ballasted track (approx. 20 mm before maintenance).[^2]


### 2. Vibration Speed and Dynamic Settlement Behaviour

* **Ballasted Track:** The ballast bed is susceptible to "liquefaction" if vibration speeds exceed critical limits.
    * **Liquefaction Threshold:** At frequencies >30–40 Hz, ballast can behave like a fluid. Vibration speeds >10–15 mm/s are considered safe, while speeds >20 mm/s can cause rapid instability.[^1]
    * **Dynamic Settlement:** High dynamic loads (e.g., wheel flats) cause rapid local settlement. The "memory of the track" means defects often return to the same spot even after tamping unless the lift is significant (>20 mm).[^1]
* **Ballastless Track:** Does not suffer from granular rearrangement or liquefaction. However, its high stiffness can reflect higher-frequency vibrations (40–400 Hz) back into the vehicle or transmit them into the ground if not decoupled.[^3][^4]


### 3. Comfort

This section covers the interaction between the track structure, the vehicle, and the passenger environment.

* **Noise**
    * **Ballasted Track:** Acts as a sound absorber due to the voids between stones. It is generally quieter.[^3][^1]
    * **Ballastless Track:** Acts as a sound reflector. Airborne noise is typically **3–5 dB(A) higher** than on ballasted track. Requires additional noise mitigation measures (absorptive panels, mats) to match ballasted track performance.[^2][^3]
* **Bearing Capacity of Ballast Bed**
    * **Ballasted Track:** Load is distributed via the "cone of pressure" from the sleeper through the ballast to the subgrade. The bearing capacity depends heavily on the confinement and quality of the stone. It requires a subgrade bearing capacity of Ev2 ≥ 60 MN/m².[^3][^2]
    * **Ballastless Track:** The rigid slab acts as a beam, distributing loads over a much wider area. However, because the slab is rigid, it requires a much stiffer, settlement-free subgrade (Ev2 ≥ 120 MN/m²) to prevent cracking.[^2][^3]
* **Lateral Displacement Resistance**
    * **Ballasted Track:** Relies on friction between the sleeper bottom and the ballast (approx. 50–60% of resistance) and the ballast shoulder. It is the "weakest link" for continuous welded rail (CWR) stability, susceptible to buckling in heat. Enhanced designs like **Frame Sleepers** or **Ladder Sleepers** can increase this resistance by 60% to 600%.[^1]
    * **Ballastless Track:** Provides extremely high lateral resistance because the rails are fastened to a fixed concrete block. This makes it ideal for high lateral forces (e.g., curves with high superelevation) and the use of eddy current brakes, which are often restricted on ballasted track due to thermal heating risks.[^3]
* **Critical Speed of Permanent Way**
    * **Ballasted Track:** The "critical speed" is the velocity at which the train speed approaches the Rayleigh wave speed of the subsoil/ballast system. Approaching this speed causes excessive amplification of vertical displacement (shock waves), destabilizing the ballast. On soft soils, this can occur at speeds as low as 200–300 km/h unless soil is improved.[^4][^5][^1]
    * **Ballastless Track:** Due to the high stiffness and mass of the concrete slab, the system has a higher critical speed limit. It is dynamically superior for very high-speed operations (>300 km/h) on soft ground because the slab bending stiffness distributes the load and suppresses the "shock wave" effect.[^4][^3]
* **Development of Fines**
    * **Ballasted Track:** "Fines" (dust/mud) are generated by **attrition** (internal grinding of stones), **tamping** (mechanical breakage), and external sources (wagon spillage, wind). Tamping generates 1.8–4 kg of fines per sleeper per cycle.[^1]
    * **Ballastless Track:** Does not generate fines from the track structure itself. It eliminates the problem of ballast fouling.[^3]
* **Distribution of Fines in Ballast Bed**
    * **Ballasted Track:** Fine particles migrate downward and accumulate at the bottom of the ballast layer. This "fouling" reduces drainage and elasticity, eventually requiring ballast cleaning (undercutting) when void volume drops.[^1]
    * **Ballastless Track:** Not applicable (closed system).


### 4. Durability

* **Ballasted Track:** Typical service life is **30–40 years**. Performance degrades linearly or exponentially depending on maintenance quality.[^3][^1]
* **Ballastless Track:** Designed for a service life of **60 years** or more. The concrete structure is durable, but any failure (e.g., settlement cracking) is catastrophic and hard to repair.[^2][^3]


### 5. Environmental Carbon

* **Embodied Carbon:** Slab track has a significantly higher initial carbon footprint due to the large volume of cement and steel reinforcement. Production accounts for >80% of emissions.[^6]
* **Lifecycle Emissions:** Ballasted track typically produces **11–20% less CO₂** over the full lifecycle compared to slab track in open terrain. However, in **tunnels**, slab track can be more carbon-efficient because it allows for a smaller tunnel diameter (lower profile) and requires less maintenance.[^6][^3]


### 6. Whole Life Cost

* **Construction (CAPEX):** Slab track is significantly more expensive to build. Estimates range from **1.5 to 4 times** the cost of ballasted track.[^3]
* **Maintenance (OPEX):** Slab track maintenance costs are very low—approx. **20–30%** of ballasted track costs.[^2][^3]
* **Break-even:** Financial break-even is difficult to achieve solely through maintenance savings unless the line has very high traffic density or is in a tunnel. Some studies suggest a break-even period of >73 years, while others claim it is cost-effective for high-speed lines over 60 years due to higher availability.[^7][^6]


### 7. Maintenance and Renewals

* **Ballasted Track:** Requires regular, cyclical maintenance:
    * **Tamping:** To correct geometry (every ~50–80 MGT).
    * **Ballast Cleaning:** To remove fines (every ~15–20 years).
    * **Renewal:** Complete replacement after 30–40 years.[^2][^1]
* **Ballastless Track:** Requires "preventive" maintenance:
    * **Grinding:** To maintain rail surface quality (more critical than on ballast).
    * **Fastenings:** Replacement of pads/clips.
    * **Repair:** Difficult. Settlement defects (e.g., subgrade failure) require expensive injection grouting or slab jacking.[^3]


### 8. Other (Spanish Experience)

* **ADIF Experience:** In Spain (ADIF network), slab track is mandatory in tunnels >1500 m to ensure safety and availability. It is also used in stations for cleanliness and aesthetic reasons.[^2]
* **Transitions:** The transition between ballasted and slab track is a critical weak point requiring gradual stiffness changes (e.g., glued ballast, auxiliary rails) to prevent dynamic impact damage.[^2][^3]
