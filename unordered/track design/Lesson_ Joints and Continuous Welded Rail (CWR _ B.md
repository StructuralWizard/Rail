# Lesson: Joints and Continuous Welded Rail (CWR / BLS)

## 1. Rail Joints (Juntas)

### 1.1 Reason for Joints

A **rail joint** is the mechanical connection between the ends of two rails, made with **fishplates (bridas)** and bolts, leaving a small gap (“cala”) between rail ends.[^1]

Historically, joints were needed because:

- Rail length is limited by rolling and transport.
- Rails expand and contract with temperature; the joint gap allows this **thermal expansion**.[^1]
- Joints permit staged construction, phasing, and temporary track arrangements.

However, joints are **weak points** in the track because the stiffness of the rail is discontinuous (sudden change in moment of inertia), which causes dynamic problems.[^1]

Main adverse effects of joints:[^1]

- Increased traction resistance of trains.
- Contribution to longitudinal “walking” of rails.
- Ballast crushing and deterioration under impact.
- High bending stresses in rail ends, leading to permanent deformation and defects.
- Loss of ride comfort and increased fatigue of rolling stock.

Therefore, the long‑term strategic objective is to **eliminate joints** as far as possible, replacing jointed track by **continuous welded rail (CWR / BLS)**.[^1]

***

### 1.2 Position of Joints

Joints may be classified by their relative position between the two rails of the track, and relative to sleepers.

#### a) Relative position between rails (two running rails)[^1]

- **Concordant / square joints (concordantes o a escuadra)**
Both rails have their joints at the same transverse section.
    - Advantage: less noise.
    - Disadvantage: problematic in curves (simultaneous loss of continuity on both rails).
- **Staggered joints (alternadas)**
Joints on each rail are offset in longitudinal direction.
    - Disadvantage: more noise.
    - Advantage: better overall stability and distribution of dynamic effects.


#### b) Relative position with respect to sleepers (traviesas)[^1]

- **Supported joint (apoyada)**
The rail ends lie over a joint sleeper.
The sleeper receives the impact and tends to rock on the ballast, loosening the support – the joint can become dangerous.
- **Suspended joint (suspendida)**
The joint is between two adjacent “joint sleepers” placed closer together than intermediate sleepers.
This is the configuration used by most infrastructure managers, including Adif, because it is more elastic and avoids the “anvil effect” of supported joints.[^1]
- **Semi‑suspended joint (semisuspendida)**
The fishplate is long enough to reach the joint sleepers. Used to increase stiffness of suspended joints.[^1]
- **Semi‑supported on juxtaposed sleepers (semiapoyada en traviesas yuxtapuestas)**
Two sleepers are connected together with dowels to form a wide “double” sleeper. This reduces the rocking effect and facilitates tamping.[^1]

***

### 1.3 Types and Classification of Joints

#### 1.3.1 By electrical function: insulating vs non‑insulating[^1]

- **Non‑insulating joints (juntas no aislantes)**
Used solely to provide mechanical continuity, without electrical isolation.

Types include:
    - **Ordinary joint (junta ordinaria)**
Standard joint with steel fishplates, bolts, and accessories. Applications:
        - Traditional jointed track.
        - Temporary jointing during formation of continuous welded rail (CWR / BLS).[^1]
    - **Square‑end (tight) joint (junta a tope)**
Eliminates the mechanical gap by using:
        - Stronger fishplates with reduced bolt spacing to the plate centre line.
        - Larger diameter and higher‑strength bolts.
Used, for example, at switch \& crossing connections (heart connections in B3 turnouts, etc.) installed in otherwise CWR track.[^1]
    - **Quick‑clamp joint (junta CE de embridado rápido)**
Steel fishplates are tightened by a clamp (“prensa de apriete”) instead of conventional bolts.[^1]
Used when:
        - Drilling the rail is not desirable (temporary/emergency joint).
        - There is no time to drill (emergency repair).[^1]
- **Insulating joints (juntas aislantes)**
Used to obtain **electrical isolation** between rails for signalling track circuits.[^1]

Sub‑types:
    - **Non‑glued insulating joints (no encoladas)**
Used in traditional jointed track and in A‑type turnouts.

According to fishplate material:[^1]
        - *Wood‑bakelised fishplate joint (junta de madera baquelizada)* – for legacy profiles.
        - *Glass‑fibre fishplate joint (junta de fibra de vidrio)* – for more modern applications.
    - **Glued insulating joints (Juntas Aislantes Encoladas, JAE)**
Used in **CWR (BLS)** to maintain electrical isolation while resisting high longitudinal and bending forces.[^1]

By fabrication method:[^1]
        - **JAE manufactured in workshop (en taller)**
Assembled under controlled conditions from:
            - Steel fishplates.
            - Bolts and accessories.
            - Insulating liners and adhesive.
            - Two short rail coupons.
Used in B, C, V, P turnouts and on plain CWR.[^1]
        - **JAE manufactured in situ**
Built on the existing in‑track rails, rather than using prefabricated coupons.[^1]

Glued insulating joints degrade with traffic and can gradually lose functional electrical isolation; they are therefore subject to specific homologation tests such as the **CAMINSAN test**, which simulates 5 years of high‑category traffic (3,000,000 vertical load cycles, 1,826 longitudinal cycles) to verify their mechanical and electrical behaviour.[^1]

***

### 1.4 Working Mechanism and Fishplates (Bridas)

#### 1.4.1 Role of fishplates

**Fishplates (bridas)** join the ends of adjacent rails so that:

- Their longitudinal axes are aligned.
- Relative movement in vertical and horizontal planes is prevented.
- Longitudinal movement for thermal expansion is allowed (bolt holes larger than bolt shank).[^1]

As a wheel approaches the joint, the rail end tends to behave like a **cantilever**. The fishplate restrains this bending by:

- Carrying bending and shear in its middle region.
- Transferring load to the rail feet at both ends of the fishplate.[^1]

Therefore:

- The fishplate must fit tightly between rail head and rail foot.
- The lower faces of the rail head in the fishplate contact region should be as **horizontal as possible** to transmit vertical loads efficiently, though this must be balanced against wear behaviour.[^1]


#### 1.4.2 Weak points and degradation

Under bending and impact:

- **Relative movement** between rail and fishplate causes wear in the contact zones.
- **Cracks** may initiate in fishplates, especially at bolt holes.
- Bolts may **loosen, deform, or break**.
- For insulating joints, **loss of electrical isolation** may occur if insulating elements are damaged or contaminated.[^1]


#### 1.4.3 Electrical continuity and isolation

In electric traction:

- Rail joints do not always ensure sufficient continuity of the **return current**; therefore short **copper cables** are welded to the rail web on each side of the joint to bridge it.[^1]
- For signalling (track circuits), **insulation** is required:
    - Plastic liners between rail and fishplate.
    - Insulating gap in the rail section between the rail ends.
    - Isolating sleeves around bolts to avoid contact through bolt holes.[^1]

***

## 2. Continuous Welded Rail (CWR / Barra Larga Soldada, BLS)

### 2.1 Concept and General Requirements

CWR (in Spanish, **vía sin juntas con Barra Larga Soldada – BLS**) is obtained by welding together elementary or workshop rails (“barras elementales” and “barras de taller”) into **very long welded strings**, whose ends are connected to expansion devices, and which **do not experience longitudinal movement in the central zone** under normal temperature variation.[^1]

Key requirements for good behaviour of CWR/BLS:[^1]

- The **welded length should be as large as possible**.
- Track should be **as heavy as possible**:
    - Heavy rail sections (e.g. UIC 54, 60E1).
    - Concrete sleepers (monoblock) with high longitudinal resistance.
- Track must be **very well aligned and levelled**.
- Avoid curves of radius < 450 m (800 m recommended minimum) in CWR without special measures.[^1]
- High‑quality **angular ballast** with adequate depth and consolidation.
- **Elastic fastenings** with high torsional resistance that always clamp the rail firmly (e.g. Vossloh SKL‑1, Pandrol, etc.).[^1]

***

### 2.2 Restrained Expansion (Dilatación Restringida)

In jointed track, rail expansion is theoretically **free** and accommodated by the gap (cala). For a rail of length $L_0$, with thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$, a temperature change $\Delta T$ gives:

$$
\Delta L = L_0 \, \alpha \, \Delta T
$$

Using $\alpha \approx 10.96 \times 10^{-6} \ \mathrm{^{\circ}C^{-1}}$, a traditional 18 m rail and $\Delta T = 100^{\circ}C$ would expand about 20 mm, i.e. the classical maximum allowed joint gap.[^1]

In a long welded string, for example 300 m, this formula would give about 340 mm free expansion. However, **field observations** show that:

- There is a **central zone** where rail points do not move at all with temperature (zero expansion).
- Expansion is confined to end zones where the rail “breathes”.[^1]

This is because **expansion is restrained** by:

- Longitudinal resistance of fastenings (rail–sleeper).
- Friction between sleepers and ballast.
- Friction between ballast and formation.[^1]

Typical resistance per sleeper (order of magnitude given in the Spanish notes):[^1]

- Wooden sleepers: ~500 kg (per sleeper).
- Concrete biblock: ~750 kg.
- Concrete monoblock, heavy rail: ~1,000 kg.

Thus, in CWR the rail **does not expand freely**; instead, temperature variation produces **longitudinal stresses** in the rail and reaction forces in the track structure.

***

### 2.3 Longitudinal Thermal Stress and “Breathing Length”

In a perfectly restrained bar (no longitudinal displacement at all), the axial stress due to a temperature change $\Delta T$ is:

$$
\sigma = E \, \alpha \, \Delta T
$$

With:

- $E \approx 2.07 \times 10^{5} \ \mathrm{MPa}$ (steel).
- $\alpha = 10.96 \times 10^{-6} \ \mathrm{^{\circ}C^{-1}}$.

The corresponding stress increment is:

$$
\sigma \approx 2{,}268 \, \Delta T \ \mathrm{kN/m^2}
$$

or approximately $2.27 \, \Delta T \ \mathrm{kN/mm^2}$.[^1]

For $\Delta T = 30^{\circ}C$:

- $\sigma \approx 68{,}040 \ \mathrm{kN/m^2}$ (or 68 MPa),
- For a UIC 60 rail with area $7{,}686 \ \mathrm{mm^2}$, the force per rail is about 523 kN (≈52.3 t).[^1]

This is the **longitudinal force** that must be balanced by rail fastenings and ballast friction when expansion is fully restrained.[^1]

In reality:

- In the **central zone**, movement is practically zero and stresses reach the full thermal value (tension or compression).
- Near the ends (zones AC and DB), the available friction is not sufficient to completely prevent movement, and some expansion/contraction occurs. This defines the **“breathing lengths”** (zonas de respiración).[^1]

The breathing length $Z$ can be estimated by equilibrium of friction and thermal force:

$$
Z = \frac{2 S \, \sigma}{r} = \frac{2 S E \alpha \Delta T}{r}
$$

where $S$ is rail area and $r$ is longitudinal resistance per sleeper (or per unit length, depending on convention).[^1]

Approximate breathing lengths for UIC‑60 rail, for different temperature ranges, using typical values, are of the order:[^1]

- $\Delta T = 35^{\circ}C$: $Z \approx 12.2 \ \mathrm{m}$
- $\Delta T = 40^{\circ}C$: $Z \approx 14.2 \ \mathrm{m}$
- $\Delta T = 45^{\circ}C$: $Z \approx 15.7 \ \mathrm{m}$

(Values given directly in the Spanish notes for different rail sections.)[^1]

The longitudinal displacement of point P at distance $x$ from the start of the breathing zone (assuming linear reduction of stress) is:[^1]

$$
\Delta l(x) = \frac{\alpha \Delta T}{Z} \left( xZ - \frac{x^2}{2} \right)
$$

In particular, at the free end ($x = Z$):

$$
\Delta l_\text{end} = \frac{1}{2} \alpha \Delta T \, Z
$$

Using the example in the notes for UIC‑60 and $Z = 3.5 \ \mathrm{m}$:[^1]

- For $\Delta T = 30^{\circ}C$: $\Delta l \approx 17.3 \ \mathrm{mm}$.
- For $\Delta T = 60^{\circ}C$: $\Delta l \approx 69.1 \ \mathrm{mm}$.

These are the longitudinal movements that must be **accommodated by expansion devices** at the CWR ends.[^1]

***

### 2.4 Expansion Devices (Aparatos de Dilatación)

At the **ends** of a CWR string, rail longitudinal stress must drop to zero, and the remaining expansion must be accommodated by **expansion devices** (aparatos de dilatación, AD).[^1]

They are used:

- At transitions between **CWR and jointed track**.
- At connections to S\&C layouts or structures that cannot be welded continuously.
- At the ends of bridges or special structures without rail expansion capability.[^1]

The Spanish notes show a typical device used by Adif, capable of absorbing up to **180 mm of movement**, which is far greater than the theoretical 17–70 mm range for typical temperature variations.[^1]

If CWR connects to another CWR section (same neutral temperature, no structural discontinuity), an expansion device may not be required.[^1]

***

### 2.5 Neutralisation and Stress‑Free (Neutral) Temperature

#### 2.5.1 Key definitions[^1]

- **Free‑stress temperature (temperatura de libre esfuerzo, $t_{le}$)**
Temperature at which longitudinal stress in a particular rail segment is **zero**. It depends purely on the **actual rail length**:
the length it would have if free and at that temperature.
    - If the rail is stretched (longer), its $t_{le}$ increases.
    - Completely independent of climate – determined by installation condition.
- **Neutralisation temperature (temperatura de neutralización, $t_n$)**
Target temperature at which the rail is to be **stress‑free after neutralisation**.
Defined for each area as:

$$
t_n = \frac{t_{max} + t_{min}}{2} + 5^{\circ}C
$$

where $t_{max}$ and $t_{min}$ are the extreme **rail** temperatures over years.[^1]
In the Spanish network, current values are typically between **25 °C and 38 °C**.[^1]
- **Fixing / constituting temperature (temperatura de fijación o de constitución, $t_f$)**
Average rail temperature during:
    - Welding of elementary/workshop rails.
    - Tightening of fastenings to form provisional welded strings.
If the track is mounted from pre‑welded workshop rails, $t_f$ is the average rail temperature during their final fixing in the track; otherwise it can be indeterminate.[^1]
- **Neutralisation of a rail**
Operation by which the rail is fixed such that its **free‑stress temperature** equals or is very close to the **neutralisation temperature** of the zone, with stresses being homogeneous along the length.[^1]

The difference $t_n - t_{le}$ quantifies the current stress state in the rail: the bigger the difference, the more unfavourable the stress regime.[^1]

***

### 2.6 Neutralisation Process (Anchoring and Stressing)

To ensure safe behaviour, CWR must be **neutralised** after installation. Neutralisation is always done **after the track is sufficiently stabilised**, generally after at least **100,000 t of traffic** if sleepers or ballast have been newly placed or disturbed.[^1]

#### 2.6.1 Preliminary conditions[^1]

- Install provisional welded strings (bars joined by fishplates, sleepers and fastenings installed).
- Adjust fastening torque and weld elementary/workshop bars, leaving **central gaps** (calas) for neutralisation.
- Ensure track geometry is correct and ballast is properly compacted.
- Avoid having level crossings or bridges without expansion devices within the breathing zones.

It is recommended to install the track such that $t_f \le t_n$ to simplify subsequent tensioning.[^1]

#### 2.6.2 Methods of neutralisation[^1]

Neutralisation is always executed on **two semi‑bars** separated by a central gap and bounded by fixed points at their ends.[^1]

Two main methods are defined in the Spanish teaching document:[^1]

1. **Neutralisation by tensioning (por tracción)**
The rail is **mechanically stretched** using hydraulic jacks until the required length corresponding to $t_n$ is reached.
    - Advantage: can be done at any rail temperature provided it is **below or equal** to $t_n$.
    - Disadvantage: execution is more complex in **tight curves** (geometry control and jack reaction).
2. **Neutralisation by solar heating (por calentamiento solar)**
Uses the natural increase (or decrease) of rail temperature from solar radiation until it approaches $t_n$.
    - Advantages:
        - No special equipment.
        - Can be used in curves of small radius.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Difficult to measure rail temperature precisely during rapid warming (e.g. sunny mornings).
        - Requires good knowledge of temperature evolution to choose the right moment.
        - Possible time loss while waiting for target temperature.[^1]

#### 2.6.3 Basic steps (common to both methods)[^1]

Main phases indicated in the Spanish notes (for both tensioning “T” and heating “C”, except where marked):[^1]

1. **Selection of the length to be released.**
2. **Establishment of fixed points (constitución de puntos fijos)** at both ends of the section to be neutralised.
3. **Measurement of rail temperature.**
4. **Release and homogenisation of stresses:**
    - Cut the rail.
    - Loosen fastenings in the release length.
    - “Macear” (hammer) the rail while it rests on rollers to free locked‑in stresses.
5. **(Tensioning method only)**
    - Mark rail and sleepers to control elongation.
6. **Dimensioning of the central gap (cala central)** so that final length corresponds to $t_n$.
7. **Tensioning of the rail (T method)** using jacks to bring the marks to the required separation.
8. **Tightening of fastenings** to lock the neutralised length.
9. **Welding of the semi‑bars** (usually aluminothermic in situ).
10. **Record all data** in a Neutralisation Report (Acta de Neutralización) for traceability.[^1]

The Spanish document includes schemes showing fixed points PF1, PF2, PF3 around the neutralised zone, marking and tensioning sequences, and target distances (e.g. 50 m on both sides of central gap).[^1]

***

### 2.7 Welding of Rails

#### 2.7.1 Definitions[^1]

- **Elementary rail (barra elemental):**
Rail directly from rolling mill, typical length 18 m.
- **Workshop rail (barra de taller):**
Rail formed in workshop/yard by welding several elementary rails for transport to site; RENFE historically used 288 m (16 × 18 m).[^1]
Maximum length is limited by transport constraints.
- **Continuous welded rail (barra larga soldada, BLS):**
In‑situ welded sequence of workshop rails, creating very long strings forming CWR.


#### 2.7.2 Main welding processes

- **Aluminothermic welding (soldadura aluminotérmica)** – typically used in track:[^1]
    - Exothermic reaction between aluminium and iron oxide produces molten steel, which fuses and fills the gap between preheated rail ends.
    - Characteristics:
        - Simple and robust manual process.
        - Relatively cheap.
        - Filler metal is not identical in composition and properties to the parent rail steel.
        - Manual process, about 20 minutes per weld (2–3 welds/hour).[^1]
        - Internal residual stresses due to differential cooling of head, web, and foot.
    - Basic steps:[^1]
        - Align rails and clamp mould around gap.
        - Preheat rail ends.
        - Fill crucible with thermite mixture.
        - Ignite reaction.
        - After reaction, open crucible bottom to let molten steel flow into mould (about 10 s after reaction ends).
        - Allow weld to cool for about 3 minutes.
        - Remove mould, de‑burr (porrón) and grind profile with rail‑grinding tools.
- **Flash‑butt electric resistance welding (soldadura eléctrica a tope por resistencia)** – used mostly in workshops, but also on site with mobile plants:[^1]
    - Rail ends are brought together, aligned, and heated by high electric current (approx. 35,000 A, 5 V). When steel is plastic, ends are forged together (“recalque”).
    - Features:
        - Weld metal is exactly the same as rail steel – no filler.
        - Fully automated process – better quality and consistency.
        - Output: 6–10 welds per hour.
        - Loss of about 4 cm of rail length per weld due to trimming and forging.
        - Requires specialised, expensive machinery – higher initial cost.[^1]
    - Process steps:[^1]
        - Bring rails close and align/level.
        - Apply current and slowly press together.
        - Forge during final phase.
        - Rough de‑burring, then fine finishing and grinding.

Rail welding quality is essential in CWR because poor welds are a common location for **rail breaks** and defects (e.g. head checks, shelling, fractures).[^1]

***

### 2.8 Anchoring of CWR

Anchoring refers to ensuring sufficient **longitudinal resistance** between rail and track structure so that thermal forces do not cause excessive movement or buckling.

Key elements (from the Spanish “Sujeciones y juntas” notes and the TrackCompendium chapter on rails and fastenings):[^1]

- **Fastenings:** must provide:
    - Stable gauge and rail inclination.
    - High longitudinal resistance (to counter thermal forces).
    - Adequate vertical and lateral stiffness, with controlled elasticity.
    - Electrical insulation where required (circuits).[^1]
- Typical systems in Spain (for CWR and high speeds) are **elastic fastenings with clips**, especially Vossloh SKL‑1 on concrete monoblock sleepers.[^1]
These provide:
    - Elastic clamping via clip deformation.
    - Good adjustment of load–deformation curve.
    - Reliable electrical insulation.
    - Very limited maintenance needs.
- Ballast and formation must be:
    - Well compacted and adequately thick (see Plataforma y Balasto and TrackCompendium chapters for dimensions and quality requirements).
    - Free from fouling and water accumulation to maintain friction and support.

If anchoring is insufficient (e.g. due to poor ballast compaction, missing fastenings, or degraded components), the effective breathing length increases and there is higher risk of **track buckling** in hot weather or **pull‑apart breaks** in cold weather.[^1]

***

### 2.9 Stress‑Free (Neutral) Temperature – Design and Behaviour

Selecting an appropriate **neutral temperature** $t_n$ is critical:

- Too low $t_n$:
    - Large compression in hot weather.
    - Increased risk of lateral buckling (track “sun kink”).
- Too high $t_n$:
    - Large tension in cold weather.
    - Increased risk of **rail breaks** and failures at welds or joints.[^1]

Using the expression for stress:

$$
\sigma = E \alpha (T_{rail} - t_n)
$$

Infrastructure managers (e.g. Adif, Network Rail, HS2) specify a permissible **range of neutral temperatures** and procedures for their verification and maintenance.[^1]
The Spanish notes explicitly give the formula for $t_n$ and the current range used.[^1]

Neutral temperature is considered a **local parameter**, as it can vary with micro‑climate, solar exposure, altitude, or cuttings/embankments.[^1]

***

### 2.10 Typical CWR Failures

Continuous welded rail improves dynamic behaviour and reduces maintenance, but introduces specific failure modes associated with **longitudinal thermal stress**.

From the Spanish “Sujeciones y juntas” document, together with the TrackCompendium chapter on rails:[^1]

#### 2.10.1 Buckling and lateral instability (“pandeo”)

- In **high temperatures**, rail is in **compression**.
- If lateral and torsional restraint (ballast, fastenings, sleepers) is insufficient, the track may **buckle laterally** (“snaking”).
- Typically occurs in regions where:
    - Ballast is fouled or under‑compacted.
    - Fastenings are missing or loose.
    - Geometry imperfections (alignment faults) exist.
- Consequences:
    - Immediate speed restrictions.
    - Potential derailment if undetected.


#### 2.10.2 Rail breaks and longitudinal separations

- In **low temperatures**, rail is in **tension**.
- High tension can lead to:
    - **Brittle fractures** in the rail, especially at defects, welds, bolt holes, or old head checks/squats.
    - **Pull‑apart** at weak welds or poor aluminothermic welds.
- Fatigue or manufacturing defects can be critical under these stresses.[^1]


#### 2.10.3 Failures of glued insulating joints (JAE)

- JAE in CWR are locations with:
    - Local stiffness discontinuity.
    - Complex stress state (bending + tension/compression).
- Under repeated passage loads and thermal cycles:
    - Bond between insulation and steel can deteriorate.
    - Fishplates or bolts can crack or lose prestress.
    - Electrical isolation may be lost.[^1]
- Therefore, JAE are tested according to CAMINSAN procedure and monitored in service.[^1]


#### 2.10.4 Weld defects

- Improper aluminothermic or flash‑butt welds (poor alignment, incomplete fusion, internal porosity, inadequate grinding) become preferential locations for **cracks** and **fractures**.[^1]
- During grinding campaigns, weld zones must be carefully maintained to avoid notch effects.


#### 2.10.5 Progressive loss of anchoring

- Missing clips, corroded bolts, broken shoulders or baseplates, fouled ballast, sinkage – all reduce longitudinal resistance.
- Effective breathing length increases, CWR behaviour deviates from design assumptions, and both buckling and break risks rise.[^1]

        - Many serious failures are related to poor control of longitudinal behaviour.

This structure integrates both Spanish teaching materials on **“Sujeciones y juntas”** and international track engineering practice, suitable for an advanced Permanent Way engineering course.[^1]
