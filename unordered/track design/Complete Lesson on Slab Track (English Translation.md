# Complete Lesson on Slab Track (English Translation)

**Key idea:** Slab track replaces ballast with a rigid slab (concrete or asphalt) with elastic elements below the rail or sleeper. It offers very stable geometry and low maintenance, but requires extremely high-quality bearing platforms, higher initial investment, and presents significant challenges over embankments and in noise/vibration aspects.[^1][^2]

***

## 1. Concept and fundamental properties of slab track

**Basic definition**

Slab track is track in which the ballast has been replaced by one or more layers of rigid or semi-rigid materials (in situ or prefabricated concrete slab, asphalt base, metallic base), sometimes eliminating the sleeper as well. All functions of the ballast and, where applicable, the sleeper, are transferred to the slab, elastic elements, and fastening system.[^2][^1]

**Main mechanical properties**

- **High structural stiffness and vertical uniformity:**
– Typical stress transmission to bearing: between $1$ and $3\ \text{N/cm}^2$.[^1]
– Very rigid structure: plastic deformation is practically nil, elasticity provided by base plates, pads, and elements below slab.[^2]
- **High lateral resistance and rail buckling resistance:**
– The monolithic slab provides high resistance to lateral displacement, very favorable for high speed and intense braking (e.g., eddy-current brake).[^1][^2]
- **Durability and service life:**
– Expected service life of the slab or bearing surface: approximately 50–60 years compared to 30–40 years for well-maintained ballasted track.[^2][^1]
– Lower degradation of rail and sub-base due to geometric stability.[^1]
- **Very stable geometry over time:**
– The track position remains practically invariable, even at very high speeds; geometric degradation is very slow.[^2][^1]
- **Reduction in construction height and clearance:**
– The track section is much thinner than ballasted track; excavation in tunnels and clearance constraints are reduced.[^1][^2]
- **Aspects of operation and maintenance:**
– Lower need for interventions (no tamping or unpacking), with significant reduction in maintenance cost and greater infrastructure availability.[^2][^1]
– On Shinkansen, slab track maintenance costs are cited as 20–30% of ballasted track; on Rheda 2000 in Germany around 10%; in Spain estimated at 40–50%.[^1]
- **Acoustic and vibratory behavior:**
– Airborne noise emission higher than ballasted track: typical correction +5 dB(A) relative to wooden sleeper track.[^2]
– Higher structural noise in the 250–1000 Hz range, unless special elastic elements, floating slabs, absorptive material, etc. are introduced.[^1][^2]

## 2. Requirements for slab track

The requirements are significantly more stringent than for ballasted track, both in substructure and in bound and unbound layers.[^2][^1]

### 2.1 Substructure and subsoil

- **Practically zero and very uniform settlements:**

– Unlike ballasted track, where settlements up to 2 cm in 10 m are admitted (compensable with maintenance machinery), in slab track residual settlements must be very small and within the compensation capability of fastening devices (typically ±20–26 mm vertical and up to 9 mm lateral).[^2]

– The slab track substructure must be secured by earthwork measures down to 2.5 m below the bearing plate, compared to 0.5 m below the frost-protective layer in ballasted track.[^2]
- **Minimum bearing capacity:**

– Soil deformation modulus:
    - For slab track: Ev2 ≈ 60 N/mm² (new track) on the surface of the subgrade, compacted to 3 m depth (Dpr 0.98–1.0).[^2]
    - For new construction: dense geotechnical campaigns required (boreholes every 50 m to 6 m depth).[^2]

– Soft cohesive soils, organic soils, peats, etc. must be replaced to at least 4 m below track level, or improved (gravel columns, injections, preloading, etc.).[^2]
- **On embankments:**

– Limit embankment heights (e.g., for Rheda, typical limits cited are 2–5 m or up to 5–10 m only with very good geotechnical conditions), due to deferred settlements.[^1]
– Use of high-quality embankment material (e.g., QS2–QS3 soils in Spanish classification), strict compaction, and, if necessary, special foundation works (piles, slabs over gravel columns, etc.).[^1]
- **In cuttings:**

– Local drainage, waterproofing, and stabilization of slopes and bottom, with treatments (lime/cement, drainage, geotextiles, etc.).[^1]
– Require high-quality support soils (QS1–QS3) and thorough control of stiffness and compaction.[^1]


### 2.2 Bound layers (bearing layers)

- **Upper slab (concrete or asphalt bearing layer):**

– Concrete quality type B35 (≥ C30/37 approx.), cement content 350–370 kg/m³, with distribution reinforcement 0.8–0.9% for cracks < 0.5 mm.[^2]
– Typical thickness 18–20 cm, with surface profile tolerance of ±2 mm.[^2]
– In sleeper-less designs, cuts or joints are made approximately every 2 m to control cracking.[^2]

– In systems with asphalt base (Getrac, ATD, etc.), 4 layers are used with total thickness ≈ 30 cm, tolerance also ±2 mm, with UV protection (gravel, etc.).[^1][^2]
- **Hydraulically bound layer (HGT):**

– Typical thickness ≈ 30 cm, of graded aggregates (0–32 mm) with hydraulic binder (Portland cement, ~110 kg/m³).[^2]
– Minimum width ≈ 3.8 m.
– Target global stiffness: Ev2 modulus ≈ 120 N/mm² measured on the frost-protective layer.[^2]


### 2.3 Unbound layers and drainage conditions

- **Frost protective layer / formation layer:**

– Gravels resistant to weathering and frost, with drainage and interrupted capillary function.[^2]
– Typical permeability: $10^{-5}–10^{-4}\ \text{m/s}$.[^2]
– Ev2 modulus ≥ 120 N/mm² (new work) or ≥ 100 N/mm² (upgrade).[^2]
- **Drainage and waterproofing:**

– Necessary very effective drainage system, especially in tunnels and structures, to prevent washout under slabs and localized frost.[^1][^2]
– Groundwater levels, deep drainage, and protection against collapse must be studied with greater rigor than in ballasted track.[^2]


### 2.4 Technological integration requirements

- **Signaling and E+M systems:**

– Free zones for cables, cabinets, masts, etc., must be provided before concreting; signaling design must be finalized before executing slab track.[^1][^2]
– Electromagnetic and return current requirements:
    - Reinforcement of slabs and reinforcements with electrical continuity and earthing (at each catenary support).[^2]
    - Insulation between rails (pads, plastic guide plates) to ensure sufficient insulation resistance for track circuits.[^2]

## 3. Slab track in tunnels

### 3.1 Reasons to prefer slab track in tunnels

- Tunnels are the **infrastructure most compatible** with slab track.[^1][^2]
- In ballasted track in tunnels typical problems appear:
– High construction height → section enlargement and higher excavation costs.
– Maintenance (tamping, unpacking) very complex due to access and clearance constraints.[^1]
– Drainage clogging, presence of water, and ballast settlement → loss of geometric quality.[^1]
– Difficulties in passenger evacuation and emergency vehicle access while working on maintenance.[^1]
- In many regulations (e.g., Spain, Order FOM 3317/2010 and Circular 2/2012), slab track is recommended or required in long tunnels (>1500 m), and is justified through technical-economic studies in tunnels of 500–1500 m or in tunnel–viaduct successions.[^1]


### 3.2 Typical structural solution in tunnel

- **Invert slab + slab track layer:**

– The slab track layer can work structurally with the invert if designed with bonding reinforcement.[^1]
– Fewer problems with thermal movements, given the stable thermal environment of the tunnel (little slab expansion).[^1][^2]
- **Specific requirements:**

– Waterproofing (membranes, drainage sheets) and longitudinal and transverse drainage very well designed.[^1]
– Detail of slab–ballast transition at tunnel portals.[^1][^2]


### 3.3 Advantages and disadvantages in tunnels

- **Advantages:**

– Smaller excavation section (lower clearance required).[^1][^2]
– Lower maintenance and greater line availability.[^1]
– Better running surface for emergency vehicles (e.g., fire brigade).[^2]
- **Disadvantages:**

– Higher stiffness and noise; need for floating slabs, elastic elements, or embedded rail if vibration or interior noise restrictions exist.[^2][^1]
– Complex repairs following serious damage (e.g., derailment in tunnel).[^2]

***

## 4. Slab track on earth structures (embankments and cuttings)

### 4.1 Fundamental problems

- **Sensitivity to deferred and heterogeneous settlements:**

– Only small settlements can be compensated with fastenings; larger settlements create "cavities" under slab → inadmissible wheel–rail interaction.[^2]
– Over time, slow consolidation settlements can produce problems that exceed correction capabilities.[^2]
- **Requirement for deep ground treatments:**

– Stricter predimensioning than ballasted track: thick fills must be fully preconsolidated and controlled before pouring slabs.[^2]
– Need to measure settlements using geodetic bases (settlement–time curves and estimation of residual settlement before executing slab).[^2]


### 4.2 On embankments

- **Typical measures:**

– Limit embankment height; improve materials (selected high-quality fills).[^1][^2]
– Improve foundation (drainage, gravel columns, piles, preloads, vertical drains).[^1][^2]
– Use rigid intermediate layers (sub-ballast, HGT, etc.) with Ev2 ≥ 120 N/mm² and typical thicknesses ≥ 30 cm.[^1]
- In countries like Japan and Netherlands, special solutions (piles, floating slabs) have been used to install slab track on soft soils.[^1][^2]


### 4.3 In cuttings

- **Recommended measures:**

– Foundation drainage, treatment of marginal soils, waterproofing of slopes and bottom, use of geotextiles and drainage systems.[^1][^2]
– High requirements for stiffness and homogeneity of formation and sub-ballast layers.[^1]


### 4.4 Economic comparison with ballast on earth structures

- On open embankments, slab track is usually **less economically efficient** than ballasted track, due to:[^2]
– Additional costs of substructure treatment (factor 2–2.5 compared to ballast in some studies).[^2]
– Need for frost-protective layers of at least 70 cm and deep ground assurance.[^2]

***

## 5. Slab track over viaducts and bridges

### 5.1 Problems of ballasted track on bridges

- Greater stiffness of bearing (concrete slab) → increased tensions in ballast and particles.[^1]
- Lateral and vertical confinement → accelerated degradation, higher "hammering" and risk of ballast contamination.[^1][^2]
- Tamping work on concrete surfaces can damage the surface and accelerate degradation.[^1]

Therefore, elastic gravel under sleeper, elastic plates, or very elastic fastenings (e.g., LoaRV 300) are recommended to increase elasticity and reduce ballast stresses.[^2][^1]

### 5.2 Advantages of slab track over structures

- **Possibility to design the deck specifically for slab track**, with:
– Consideration of additional dead load (slab + HGT + etc.).[^1][^2]
– Reduction of allowable dynamic amplification factor of the structure due to very regular track geometry.[^2][^1]
- Facilitates coordinating certain high-speed solutions, lines with high radii and superelevations, and avoids ballast flight at high speed.[^2]


### 5.3 Key structural requirements

- Compatibility of:

– **Vertical movements** deck–slab: rotational freedom, elastic or sliding supports where necessary.[^1]
– **Longitudinal movements** deck–rail: due to thermal effects and braking, with expansion devices, special fastenings, etc.[^1][^2]
– **Transverse displacements** (wind, seismic) of deck relative to abutments or between adjacent decks.[^1]
- Proper transmission of longitudinal and transverse track stresses to the structure, without creating tension concentrations in the slab.[^2][^1]

## 6. Comparison between ballasted track and slab track

### 6.1 Technical comparison

| Aspect | Ballasted track | Slab track |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Load distribution element | Granular ballast | Rigid slab (concrete/asphalt) + elastic elements |
| Construction height | High | Significantly lower (lower clearance required) |
| Track geometry | Progressively degrades, requires tamping | Very stable over time |
| Overall elasticity | Given by ballast + sleeper + fastenings | Given almost solely by fastenings and slab support elements |
| Airborne noise | Lower, absorptive effect of ballast | Higher (+5 dB(A) approx. without mitigation)[^2] |
| Vibrations | Lower at source | Higher; requires specific solutions (floating slabs) |
| Sensitivity to settlements | Moderate; compensable with maintenance | Very high; compensation limited in fastenings |
| Maintenance automation | Very high (tampers, cleaners, etc.) | Very low; complex and manual repairs[^2] |

### 6.2 Economic comparison

- **Investment cost (European reference):**
– Ballasted track: ≈ 350 €/m–0.85 M€/km (according to chapter 10 of Track Compendium, indicative values).[^2]
– Slab track: cheapest meter ≈ 500 €/m; most systems between 750 and 1,100 €/m (factor 1.5–2 compared to ballast).[^2]
– The Rheda 2000 design typically costs ≈ 1.5 times (or more) than equivalent ballasted track.[^2]
- **Maintenance:**

– Ballasted track: higher recurrent cost; highly mechanizable, track position correctable within hours after serious damage.[^2]
– Slab track: very low maintenance cost, but major repairs (e.g., from derailment, significant settlement) are complex, costly, and involve prolonged line closures.[^2]
- **Conclusion from many European studies:**
Slab track **is economically advantageous** in tunnels and certain stable structures, but **is not, in general, on earth structures in the open**, except under very specific conditions (high speed, intensive traffic, clearance restrictions, etc.).[^1][^2]

## 7. Typologies of slab track (design types)

The documentation in Spanish and the Track Compendium describe a classification by slab type and support type.[^1][^2]

### 7.1 General classification (UC Cantabria)

- **By bearing slab type:** concrete or asphalt.[^1]
- **By sleeper–slab behavior:**
– **Monolithic with sleeper:** sleeper embedded in slab (Rheda, Züblin, Rheda–Dywidag, Rheda 2000, BB–Porr).[^1][^2]
– **Direct sleeper support** on asphalt base (Getrac, ATD).[^1]
– **No sleeper, continuous rail support:** direct fastening DFF, Ironless, EDF, etc.[^2][^1]
– **Special constructions:** floating slabs, embedded rail (Edilon, block/pad systems LVT, Tranosa, Viesa).[^1][^2]


### 7.2 Main typologies (summary)

- **Monolithic systems with sleeper in in-situ concrete slab:**

– **Rheda / Rheda Dywidag / Rheda 2000:** sleeper embedded in in-situ slab, with or without concrete trough, and Rheda 2000 variant with better sleeper–slab bond.[^2][^1]
– **Züblin:** sleepers are vibrated into the fresh concrete of the main bearing slab.[^1][^2]
- **Systems with prefabricated concrete slabs:**

– **Shinkansen (Japan):** prestressed concrete bearing slabs resting on concrete base with cylindrical stoppers and self-leveling cement–asphalt mortar.[^2][^1]
– **Bögl:** fiber-reinforced concrete slabs (B55) with induced break points and bituminous mortars for seating.[^2]
– **BB–Porr:** prefabricated slabs on stable substructure (typically tunnels), seating with mortar and elastic covering at interface to facilitate replacement.[^2]
- **Systems with asphalt base + sleepers:**

– **Getrac:** monoblock sleepers on asphalt package (multiple S–25 layers, cement-stabilized gravel), with concrete "stopper" as anchor and stress transmission.[^1][^2]
– **ATD:** sub-ballast, cement-stabilized gravel, multiple asphalt layers, and sleeper fixed with injected synthetic mortar; direct support on asphalt.[^1][^2]
- **Sleeper-less systems, with embedded or jacketed rail:**

– **Edilon / embedded rail:** rail in concrete channels filled with elastomer (Corkelast) with possible hollow tube to reduce rubber volume.[^1]
– **Elastic block systems (LVT, Tranosa, Viesa):** concrete or rubber blocks bonded with elastomer, with rail supported on elastic socket systems.[^1]
- **Floating slabs and anti-vibration solutions:**

– **Floating slab FST:** small post-tensioned slab (≈ 1.25×2.85 m, thickness ≥20 cm) on discrete elastomeric supports; high vibration attenuation.[^1]
– Similar solutions with continuous support (elastomeric mats) for vibration-sensitive areas.[^2][^1]
- **Other systems (for example in Germany):**

– **Heitkamp:** mixture of ballast with mortar on concrete trough.[^2]
– **SATO / FFYS (Y-steel sleepers):** Y-type metal sleepers on asphalt with special anchor systems.[^2]
– **BTD:** monoblock sleepers anchored by dowels to concrete slab.[^2]
– **Infundo, SFF, Saargummi:** embedded/fastened rail systems using elastomers and special profiles.[^2]

## 8. Use of slab track in China (CRTS) and reported problems

There are numerous external references in English and Chinese on the **CRTS** (China Railway Track System) systems, but the integrated search tool did not return specific web results in this session. Within the accessible sources, verified figures for kilometers per CRTS type and a complete quantitative balance of operational problems are not available.

What can be stated reliably (without inventing figures) is the following, drawing on technical parallels with European and Japanese systems described in Track Compendium and Spanish bibliography, but **without attributing specific numerical data to China**:

- China has massively adopted slab track on its high-speed lines (similar to Japan and Germany), using different systems of continuous slab and prefabricated slabs on viaducts, tunnels, and significantly improved embankments.
- CRTS systems are conceptually equivalent to:
– Monolithic slab track with sleeper (Rheda-like type).
– Slab track with prefabricated slabs similar to Japanese / Bögl type.
– Variants with asphalt base in certain sections.
- **Typical problems** observed in comparable slab track systems (Japan, Germany, per Track Compendium) and also described in publications on China in international literature (not retrieved here, thus not cited numerically) include:

– **Slab cracking and filling mortar degradation:**
    - In Japan, problems with frost resistance of bituminous–cement mortar and slab arching at joints in Shinkansen tunnels have been detected.[^2]
    - By analogy, in China CRTS slabs have reported cases of longitudinal and transverse cracks, due to shrinkage, thermal gradients, and execution defects, treatable with injections, recasting, or partial replacements (information of a general character, not quantified here due to lack of accessible source).

– **Degradation of seating mortars and voids under slabs:**
    - Track Compendium mentions, for European examples, the appearance of cavities and the need for grout injections to lift slabs after deferred ground settlements (Berlin–Hannover line case).[^2]
    - In China, similar pathologies have been documented (cracked mortar, loss of bearing, need for re-injections), which is consistent with the sensitivity of slab track to ground movements.

– **Deferred settlements in large embankments:**
    - In any slab track system, if embankments are not fully consolidated, slow settlements occur. Track Compendium insists on the need to measure them before pouring slabs.[^2]
    - The Chinese network has very long sections on embankment; international literature cites reinforcement interventions (injections, subgrade treatment) for settlements larger than predicted in certain sectors.

– **Noise and vibration problems:**
    - Like in Europe, the stiffness of slab track increases airborne noise (≈ +5 dB) and structural vibrations, putting pressure on the design of mitigation measures (barriers, floating slabs, highly elastic fastenings).[^2]
    - In Chinese urban environments, elastomeric solutions of higher performance (floating slabs, LVT blocks, etc.) have had to be incorporated to comply with vibration limits.

– **Complexity of maintenance and repair:**
    - In all countries, including China, slab track presents longer repair times in case of serious incidents (derailments, damage from earthquakes or flooding), compared to the ability to rapidly reconstruct ballasted track with heavy machinery.[^2]

Given that specific data on kilometers per CRTS type and detailed failure cases in China do not appear in the available technical documents (UC Cantabria and Track Compendium) nor in search results accessible in this session, **it is not possible to provide figures or specific incident lists without violating the instruction not to invent data**.

## 9. Conclusions for PWI track design (ballasted track vs slab track)

1. **When to choose slab track:**

– Long tunnels or tunnel–viaduct successions with clearance restrictions and maintenance access constraints.[^1]
– Viaducts and structures with high geometric stability requirements, very high speeds, or ballast flight problems.[^1][^2]
– Urban areas with high demands for geometric robustness and intensive traffic, where floating slab or embedded rail solutions can be justified.
2. **When to prefer improved ballasted track:**

– Long stretches over earth structures in the open with reasonable soils, where deep treatment costs for slab track would be very high.[^1][^2]
– Lines with need for future geometric modification or expansions; slab track is inflexible for changes and for incorporating future innovations.[^2]
3. **Key PWI design criteria:**

– Always verify the **chain of stiffnesses**: rail–fastening–sleeper/block–slab–bound layers–unbound layers–subgrade, progressively, with no abrupt jumps.[^1][^2]
– Control slab–ballast transitions with specific solutions (HGT wedges, distribution rails, glued ballast, progressive stiffness changes in fastenings).[^2]
– In tunnels and viaducts, finalize drainage, signaling, and E+M design from early phases before concreting, because slab track leaves very little margin for later modifications.[^1][^2]

With these references, slab track becomes a very powerful tool for high-speed lines and singular environments, provided that geotechnical, construction, and transition design requirements are strictly respected, and it is accepted that flexibility for future modification is less than in ballasted track.
